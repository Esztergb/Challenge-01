## User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

* GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

* THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* WHEN I view the icon and image elements
* THEN I find accessible alt attributes
* WHEN I view the heading attributes
* THEN they fall in sequential order
* WHEN I view the title element
* THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Description

This project was created to show my understandimg of what I learned on basic HTML and CSS functions and relations during the first week of the bootcamp. 

The main critiria was to make the example html code more accesible for screen readers and other users. To do that I had to change non-semantic elements to semantic elements add "alt" attributes to Images and chnage some background colors to achive correct contrast levels

Semantic HTML means using correct HTML elements for their correct purpose as much as possible. Semantic elements are elements with a meaning.
* Examples of non-semantic elements: **nav** and **span**, these tell nothing about their content.
* Examples of semantic elements: **form**, **table**, and **article** they clearly define their content.

The alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it.

I was also able to use DevTools to check if some of the colors were accessible enough.

I have also added comments in the html and css files to explain functionality and changes.
